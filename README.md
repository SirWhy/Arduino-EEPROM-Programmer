# Arduino-EEPROM-Programmer
> Simple Arduino based EEPROM programmer

As part of my <a href='https://github.com/SirWhy/6809'>6809 Microcomputer</a> project, I need to write/verify/erase EEPROM several times. Instead of buying an expensive programmer, an Arduino and a few shift registers will achieve the same results.

This sort of project has been carried out many times before, I don't plan on coding up an amazingly fast and efficient programmer, but rather a quick, easy to understand programmer functional to my needs.

# Arduino-EEPROM-Programmer
> Simple Arduino based EEPROM programmer

As part of the <a href='https://github.com/SirWhy/6809'>6809 Microcomputer</a> there is a need to write/verify/erase EEPROM several times. Instead of buying an expensive programmer, an Arduino and a few shift registers will achieve the same results.

This sort of project has been carried out many times before. This is a quick implementation inspired again by <a href='https://github.com/74hc595/ROMburner'>Matt Sarnoff's work</a>.
